# 🚀 SteakNStake Launch Sequence

## Critical Path: Webapp First, Then Contracts

**Why this order matters:**
- Users need somewhere to go when they get tipped
- We need to test the full flow before going live
- Contract deployment is irreversible - webapp can be iterated

- [ ] **Wallet connection working**
- [ ] **Basic staking UI functional (even with mock data)**

### Phase 2: Token Creation
- [ ] **Create $STEAK token via Clanker**

- [ ] **Monitor for issues**

## 🔍 Current Status Check

### Frontend Status:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Does it start without errors?
# Do pages load correctly?
# Are environment variables configured?
```

### Backend Status:
```bash
# Check Railway deployment
curl https://happy-determination-production.up.railway.app/api/health
# Returns: {"status": "healthy"}
```

### Database Status:
```bash
# Check if database schema is applied
# Check if Railway PostgreSQL is connected
```

## 🚨 Potential Issues to Address

### Frontend Issues:
- Missing environment variables
- API URL pointing to wrong backend
- Wallet connection not configured
- UI breaking on mobile
- Missing claim interface for tips

### Backend Issues:
- Database not connected
- Missing environment variables
- API routes returning errors
- No tip processing logic yet

### Integration Issues:
- CORS configuration
- API authentication
- Contract ABI not matching frontend
- Gas estimation errors

## 🛠️ Immediate Action Items

### 1. **Test Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Check console for errors
```

### 2. **Test Backend**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
# Test all API endpoints
# Verify database connection
```

### 3. **Integration Test**
```bash
# Frontend → Backend communication
# Mock staking flow
# Mock tip claiming flow
```

### 4. **Mobile Testing**
```bash
# Test on mobile devices
# Check wallet connection on mobile
# Verify responsive design
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria Before Launch

### ✅ **Webapp Must:**
- Load without errors on desktop and mobile
- Allow wallet connection
- Show staking interface (even with mock data)
- Display tip claiming interface
- Have proper error handling
- Be deployed to steak.epicdylan.com

### ✅ **Backend Must:**
- Be healthy on Railway
- Return proper API responses
- Have database connection working
- Handle basic CRUD operations

### ✅ **Integration Must:**
- Frontend calls backend successfully
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Loading states work properly
- Mobile experience is smooth

## 🚀 Launch Day Flow

1. **Final webapp deployment to production**
2. **Create $STEAK token via Clanker**
3. **Deploy contracts with token address**
4. **Update webapp with contract addresses**
5. **Test one complete user journey**
6. **Go live announcement**

---

**Bottom Line**: We need a functional webapp that users can visit and use, even if it starts with basic functionality. The contracts are permanent once deployed, so the webapp needs to be ready to receive users immediately.
