                         STEAKNSTAKE WHITEPAPER
                        Social Staking Meets Farcaster Tipping
                               Version 1.0 - October 2025

================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

SteakNStake is a revolutionary social staking protocol that bridges DeFi staking 
with Farcaster's social ecosystem. Users stake $STEAK tokens to earn daily 
allowances, which can only be tipped to Farcaster creators‚Äînever claimed directly. 
This creates a sustainable tipping economy where staking rewards flow exclusively 
to content creators and community members.

Key Innovation: Tip allowances can only be 
given away, creating genuine value transfer within the Farcaster ecosystem while 
preventing mercenary farming behavior.

================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Current Issues in Social Tipping:
1. Limited tipping mechanisms on Farcaster platform
2. No sustainable reward systems for content creators
3. Lack of economic incentives for long-term community engagement
4. Difficulty monetizing social interactions without intrusive advertising

Traditional DeFi Staking Problems:
1. Rewards typically extracted from ecosystem rather than redistributed
2. No connection between financial incentives and social value creation
3. Mercenary capital that exits immediately after earning rewards

================================================================================

SOLUTION OVERVIEW

SteakNStake solves these problems through a unique "Social Staking" model:

ü•© STAKE: Lock $STEAK tokens to earn daily tip allowances
üíù TIP: Use allowances to tip Farcaster creators (can't be claimed for self)
üéÅ CLAIM: Recipients claim tips to their wallets or auto-stake for more rewards

This creates a circular economy where:
- Stakers earn social capital and tipping power
- Creators receive real economic value for quality content
- Community members are incentivized to engage and support each other
- Token utility drives long-term holding rather than selling pressure

================================================================================

================================================================================

USER FLOW WALKTHROUGH

Step 1: Connect & Stake
- User connects Farcaster wallet to SteakNStake
- Stakes $STEAK tokens through miniapp interface
- Receives daily tip allowances based on stake size and duration

Step 2: Social Tipping
- User sees quality content on Farcaster
- Replies with "25 $STEAK" to tip the creator
- @steaknstake bot detects tip and processes transaction
- Tipper's allowance decreases, recipient gets claimable tip

Step 3: Claim & Grow
- Recipients visit SteakNStake to claim pending tips
- Options: "Claim to Wallet" (100%) or "Split 50/50" (wallet + auto-stake)
- Auto-staked tips immediately start earning new tip allowances
- Creates viral growth loop as recipients become tippers

Step 4: Community Building
- Leaderboards show top stakers and tippers
- Social recognition for supporting creators
- Network effects as more users join the tipping economy

================================================================================

TOKENOMICS & ECONOMIC MODEL

$STEAK Token Utility:
1. Staking: Lock tokens to earn tip allowances
2. Tipping: Only way to use earned allowances 
3. Claiming: Recipients get liquid $STEAK tokens
4. Governance: Future voting on protocol parameters

Tip Allowance Mechanics:
- Daily allowances based on: stake size √ó time locked √ó multiplier
- Cannot be claimed for personal use (prevents self-tipping)
- Creates genuine value transfer to content creators

Economic Incentives:
- Stakers: Social capital, community recognition, platform influence
- Creators: Direct monetization of quality content
- Recipients: Economic rewards for contributing value
- Protocol: Transaction fees, increased token utility and holding

Sustainable Design:
- No inflation (fixed supply model)
- Value flows from stakers ‚Üí creators (circular economy)
- Long-term staking rewarded with higher allowance multipliers
- Tips create buying pressure as recipients may re-stake

CONCLUSION

SteakNStake represents a fundamental shift in how we think about DeFi rewards 
and social value creation. By connecting staking yields to social tipping, we 
create a positive-sum economy where financial incentives align with community 
building and creator support.

The protocol addresses real problems in both DeFi (mercenary capital) and 
social platforms (creator monetization) through an elegant solution that 
benefits all participants. Stakers earn social capital, creators receive 
economic value, and the community grows stronger through meaningful interactions.

Our technical implementation prioritizes security, scalability, and user 
experience while maintaining the decentralized principles that make web3 
powerful. The Farcaster integration provides immediate utility and a clear 
path to adoption within an existing, engaged community.

As we move forward, SteakNStake will continue evolving based on community 
feedback and market needs. Our goal is not just to build a successful protocol, 
but to pioneer new models of social finance that can be replicated and adapted 
across the broader web3 ecosystem.

The future of social platforms is economic. SteakNStake is building that future 
today.
